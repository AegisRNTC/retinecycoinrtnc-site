Retinecy Network Coin (RTNC)

A transparency-first digital asset with a verifiable soft-peg floor.

RTNC demonstrates that a digital asset can operate without hidden leverage, insider allocations, or speculation-driven mechanics. Every component of RTNC — from block creation to reserve flows — prioritizes transparency, predictability, and public auditability.

This repository contains the live RTNC website, served through GitHub + Cloudflare Pages.
It includes documentation, governance materials, and transparency tools.

📜 Project Principles

1. Open Participation
Anyone may mine, inspect, or audit the network.

2. Transparency First
All governance rules, emission models, and reserve mechanics are public.

3. No Insider Allocations
No premine, no private deals, no privileged classes.

4. Predictable Emission
Block rewards follow a known schedule; no halving surprises or discretionary changes.

5. Neutral Governance
Rules exist to maintain safety and stability — not to create speculation.
