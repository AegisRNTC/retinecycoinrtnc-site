          <p class="mt-2">
            This document sets out the public risk disclosures and legal disclaimers for Retinecy (RTNC), associated metrics
            (including RMNSI and EMAVP), and all related documentation, website content, tools, charts, and communication channels
            operated under the authority of Aegis (the Caretaker, “CT”). This material is provided for informational and educational
            purposes only and is subject to change at any time.

          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">1. Preliminary Status &amp; No Legal Review</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            This documentation and the associated website content have not yet been reviewed or approved by legal counsel.
            All information is preliminary and may be revised, corrected, or removed if it is later determined to be inaccurate,
            non-compliant, or potentially misleading. Nothing in this document or on any RTNC platform should be interpreted as a
            guarantee that the current structure or wording complies with all applicable laws or regulations. Legal, regulatory, or
            policy changes may require substantial updates.

          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">2. General Disclaimer</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            RTNC is a reserve-backed digital asset. Nothing within RTNC documentation, website content, tools, dashboards, or any
            related communication should be interpreted as financial advice, investment guidance, a recommendation to buy, sell, or
            hold any asset, or a guarantee of returns, price appreciation, or stability. Users are solely responsible for their own
            decisions.

          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">3. Role of Aegis (Caretaker, CT)</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            “Aegis” is the permanent title of the Caretaker (CT). Aegis does not provide investment, trading, or tax recommendations;
            does not guarantee profitability, price performance, or stability; does not engage in private financial consultation or
            personalized advice; and does not custody user funds on behalf of the public. Any explanations, analogies, or models
            provided by Aegis or official RTNC channels are illustrative only and do not create contractual obligations.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">4. No Investment Contract &amp; No Expectation of Profit</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            RTNC is not a security, investment contract, or speculative financial product. No element of RTNC—including but not
            limited to mining, holding, staking, referrals, reserve mechanisms, EMAVP, RMNSI, or governance—guarantees or entitles
            any participant to profits, dividends, passive income, appreciation in value, yield, interest, or distributions of any
            kind. Accessing, holding, mining, or interacting with RTNC does not create any expectation of profit, obligation of
            performance, or contractual rights of any kind.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">5. Market Risk Disclosure</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Digital assets are inherently risky and may lose value rapidly. Users must understand that markets involve significant
            volatility and price swings, changes in liquidity, external exchange failures or delistings, and macroeconomic or
            regulatory events outside RTNC’s control. RTNC and Aegis bear no responsibility for any losses caused by market conditions,
            exchange behavior, or user decisions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">6. Mining Risks</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Mining RTNC involves technical, financial, and operational risks, including but not limited to hardware damage or
            failure, overheating and inadequate cooling, increased electricity consumption and related costs, reduced lifespan of
            components, declining block rewards or changing network difficulty over time, and misconfiguration, downtime, or software
            bugs. Aegis does not guarantee mining profitability, hardware performance, or any particular return from mining activities.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">7. Reserve &amp; Peg Disclosure</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            RTNC uses a mathematical reserve model, which may be expressed in formulas such as “Price Floor = Reserves ÷ Circulating
            Supply” and related EMAVP/RMNSI-style ratios or coverage indicators. While reserves and models are designed to improve
            transparency and stability, RTNC does not guarantee a specific market price or minimum trading price, peg enforcement on
            external exchanges, the behavior of third-party markets or liquidity providers, or that reserves will always be sufficient
            under all conditions. These models are descriptive tools, not promises.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">8. Software &amp; Technical Risks</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Use of RTNC software, mining clients, wallets, dashboards, websites, or any related tools is entirely at the user’s own
            risk. RTNC does not guarantee uninterrupted uptime or availability, bug-free or error-free software, immunity to
            cyberattacks, exploits, or vulnerabilities, or compatibility with all hardware, operating systems, or network setups.
            Users are responsible for using up-to-date software, applying security practices, and verifying downloads from official
            sources.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">9. Models, Metrics &amp; Gauges Are Not Guarantees</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Metrics such as EMAVP, RMNSI, reserve ratios, coverage bands, gauges, alerts, or any numerical indicators are models, not
            guarantees. They do not guarantee stability of price or peg, adequacy of reserves, performance of the network, or
            protection from loss, volatility, or drawdowns. Mathematical models, thresholds, and coverage bands may be updated,
            replaced, or removed over time as data, economics, or legal requirements evolve.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">10. User Responsibility</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Users are fully and solely responsible for securing their wallets and storing private keys safely, verifying addresses and
            transaction details before sending, managing and maintaining any mining hardware and infrastructure, and understanding and
            complying with legal obligations in their own jurisdiction. Lost private keys, mis-sent transactions, or misconfigured
            setups cannot be recovered or undone by RTNC or Aegis.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">11. No Custody Services</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            RTNC does not provide custodial services for user funds. RTNC and Aegis do not hold user assets on behalf of the public,
            cannot reverse or cancel transactions, cannot restore lost or stolen assets, and do not guarantee safety of assets held on
            third-party platforms (including exchanges, wallets, bridges, or DeFi protocols).
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">12. Third-Party Disclaimer</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            RTNC is not responsible for exchange behavior, listings, delistings, or failures; third-party wallet software bugs or
            outages; integrations built or maintained by external teams; external liquidity pools, DeFi protocols, or smart contracts;
            or hacks, rug pulls, or failures of unrelated projects claiming to use RTNC. Any third-party reference or integration is
            not an endorsement or guarantee.

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">13. Governance Disclosure</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Aegis and the Governance Body are bound by RTNC’s core design and constraints. They cannot arbitrarily alter emission in
            ways that violate core rules, change Core Pillars for personal gain, unilaterally modify the peg formula without
            transparent process, or divert reserves for personal or unauthorized purposes. Governance actions are limited to
            transparency, operational oversight, and maintenance within defined constraints. Any governance narrative is descriptive,
            not a legally enforceable governance charter.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">14. Forward-Looking Statements</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Any statements about future plans, features, or upgrades; ecosystem expansion, partnerships, or integrations; or economic
            models, peg adjustments, or governance evolution are forward-looking and represent intent, not obligation. There is no
            guarantee that planned or proposed features will launch, or that they will launch in their originally described form or
            timeline.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">15. Legal Compliance Disclaimer</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            RTNC aims to operate in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws and regulations. However, legal and regulatory
            frameworks for digital assets are evolving. Changes in law or regulation may require updates to documentation, operations,
            or governance mechanisms. RTNC may modify, restrict, or discontinue certain features or services if required to comply with
            legal obligations. Nothing in this document should be interpreted as a statement that RTNC is compliant in all
            jurisdictions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">16. No Personal Advice &amp; Independent Decision-Making</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Nothing in RTNC documentation, website content, dashboards, or communication channels should be relied upon as a substitute
            for independent professional advice. Users should not make financial, legal, tax, or other critical decisions solely based
            on RTNC materials. Independent advice from qualified professionals in the user’s jurisdiction is strongly recommended.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">17. Metaphorical &amp; Narrative Language</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            RTNC documentation and interfaces may use analogies or narrative descriptions (for example: “lockdown mode”, “red alert”,
            “shield frequencies”, “weapons online”, “capacitors charging”, or similar terms) to help explain complex systems in a more
            intuitive way. These descriptions are metaphors only. They do not represent literal system behavior, contractual
            mechanisms, or legally binding commitments. Threat levels, colors, or alerts are informational UI concepts and do not
            guarantee protection, action, or intervention by RTNC or Aegis.

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-base font-semibold text-amber-300">18. Contact</h2>
          <p class="mt-2">
            For regulatory, compliance, or legal inquiries, contact RTNC through official public channels disclosed on the main
            website. Aegis does not provide private communication regarding investments, personal financial strategies, or privileged
            access.
